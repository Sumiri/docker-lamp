LAMP server over Docker compose
------------------------------------

On the first run, mysql database needs a root password.
To do this, execute from this folder:

$ MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=yourpassword docker-compose up

Be aware that this password will probably be saved into your
bash history.

Once this boots up, you can safely close it and use the regular
command without password from now on.
